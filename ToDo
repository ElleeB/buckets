Turn links into buttons (css or html?)

User activerecord authentication errors instead of flash notice? Why do I feel I need to do this?

###

- Provide explanation for drops vs. to-do list
  + how to do this if first time in DB? Like a tutorial?
- Drop . title within for context? headings labeling drops . description
- Make description of drop optional? enter WHY important...maybe checklist + text field
- Password complexity
- Share?
- User/Show . if no drops take away upcoming deadlines and recently added drops

- Partial for activity submit = "Activity" instead of "Drop"

- Need option to mark drop complete

<!-- user can view ALL of their to-do lists organized by each of their bucket drops -->

reduce resource routes to necessary

activities /index & /show views

lists /show view

users /account & /edit & /new & /show

activities/form partial for users/show? *******
idea: <%= render "activities/form", locals: { @activity: Activity.new, submit_text: "Add Drop" }  %>

- Add :notes to lists
