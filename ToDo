User activerecord authentication errors instead of flash notice? Why do I feel I need to do this?

###

- Provide explanation for drops vs. to-do list
  + how to do this if first time in DB? Like a tutorial?
- Drop . title within for context? headings labeling drops . description
- Make description of drop optional? enter WHY important...maybe checklist + text field
- To-do list show within drop? Adding items should be on drops/show
  + what would it look like to be able to add a drop ON user/show page?
- Password complexity
- Share?
- User/Show . if no drops take away upcoming deadlines and recently added drops
